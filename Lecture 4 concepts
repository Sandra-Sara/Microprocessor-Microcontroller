RESET Signal (Pin 21)

Purpose: Used to restart (initialize) the microprocessor to a known state.
Type: Active High input signal.
ðŸ”¹ Working Process
Applied after Power-On
When power is switched on, RESET must be applied for at least 50 Âµs to properly initialize the 8086.
Duration
RESET must remain active (HIGH) for at least 4 clock cycles.
This ensures the microprocessor properly clears its internal states.
When RESET is Active (HIGH)
Execution stops (CPU does not fetch or execute instructions).
Address Bus, Data Bus, Control Bus â†’ All go to High Impedance (tri-stated).
(This avoids conflict with other devices on the bus during reset.)
ALE (Address Latch Enable) = LOW
HLDA (Hold Acknowledge) = LOW
After RESET Returns to LOW
CPU starts execution from a predefined memory location:
CS = FFFFh, IP = 0000h â†’ Physical address = FFFF0h (the reset vector).
From here, the microprocessor begins its normal instruction execution.
ðŸ”¹ Summary
Pin 21 (RESET) reinitializes the microprocessor.
Active HIGH input, must be held HIGH for at least 4 clock cycles and 50 Âµs after power-on.
While active:
Buses are tri-stated,
ALE & HLDA are low.
When released (LOW): execution starts at FFFF0h.


Pin 23 â†’ TEST


Type: Input pin to the 8086 CPU.
Purpose: Used for synchronization with the 8087 Numeric Data Processor (NDP / Math Coprocessor).
ðŸ”¹ How it Works
Connection with 8087
The BUSY output signal of the 8087 is directly connected to the TEST input of the 8086.
When 8087 is Busy
If the 8087 is executing a numeric instruction, it raises its BUSY signal = HIGH.
This makes the TEST pin = HIGH.
Seeing TEST HIGH, the 8086 enters WAIT state (halts execution temporarily).
When 8087 Finishes
Once the coprocessor finishes its task, it sets BUSY = LOW.
This drives the TEST pin LOW.
8086 detects TEST = LOW â†’ It resumes program execution normally.
ðŸ”¹ Why is this Needed?
The 8086 cannot directly execute floating-point or complex math instructions.
Instead, it offloads those tasks to the 8087 coprocessor.
To keep synchronization, 8086 must wait until 8087 finishes before continuing.
The TEST pin provides this handshake mechanism.
ðŸ”¹ Summary
TEST (Pin 23) = input to 8086, connected to BUSY output of 8087.
TEST = HIGH â†’ 8086 waits (8087 is busy).
TEST = LOW â†’ 8086 continues execution (8087 done).
