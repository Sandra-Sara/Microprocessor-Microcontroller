Flags
Registers of 8086 – Flags Register
The Flags Register in 8086 is a 16-bit register that stores the current state of the processor. It contains status flags, control flags, and unused bits.
Breakdown:
1. Conditional / Status Flags
These indicate the result of arithmetic or logical operations.
CF (Carry Flag, bit 0):
Set = if there is a carry out of the MSB (most significant bit) in addition or borrow in subtraction.
Example: FFH + 01H = 100H → CF = 1.
PF (Parity Flag, bit 2):
Set = if the result has an even number of 1s in the lower 8 bits.
Used for error checking.
AF (Auxiliary Carry Flag, bit 4):
Set = if there is a carry/borrow from bit 3 to bit 4 (used in BCD arithmetic).
ZF (Zero Flag, bit 6):
Set = if the result of an operation is 0.
SF (Sign Flag, bit 7):
Set = if the result is negative (MSB = 1).
OF (Overflow Flag, bit 11):
Set = if signed arithmetic result is too large to fit in the destination.
Example: 127 + 2 = -127 (overflow).
2. Control Flags
These control the operation of the processor.
TF (Trap Flag, bit 8):
If set → processor enters single-step (debugging) mode.
Executes one instruction at a time.
IF (Interrupt Flag, bit 9):
If set → enables maskable hardware interrupts.
If cleared → disables interrupts.
DF (Direction Flag, bit 10):
Controls string instructions.
If DF=0 → process from low address to high address (increment SI/DI).
If DF=1 → process from high address to low address (decrement SI/DI).
3. Unused bits
Some flag bits are not used (shown as U in the diagram).
