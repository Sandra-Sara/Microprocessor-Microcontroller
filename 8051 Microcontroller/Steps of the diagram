8051 architecture overview
Think of the 8051 as a tiny self-contained computer: it has a brain (CPU), memory (ROM/RAM), buses to move data, timing to keep rhythm, 
and I/O to talk to the outside world. Here’s a clear, step‑by‑step walkthrough of how each block plays its role and how data flows during program execution.

Step 1: Clock and reset bring the chip to life
Oscillator (XTAL1, XTAL2): A crystal or external clock feeds the oscillator, generating the system clock that synchronizes all operations.

Timing and control: Distributes clock pulses and control signals to the CPU, memory, and peripherals; organizes machine cycles and instruction timing.

Reset (RST): When asserted, it clears key registers, initializes the Program Counter (PC) to the reset vector, and sets the system to a known state.
